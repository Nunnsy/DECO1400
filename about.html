        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Wilderness Lifeline</em> is a text adventure game where the user plays
        becomes a part of the protagonist's, Brian's, consciousness. This creates
        an internal conversation within the character's head, allowing the player
        to manipulate the path Brian takes to survive within the dangers of the
        Canadian Wilderness.</p>

        <h2>Game Style</h2>
        <p>The 'split decision path game' was inspired by
        <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/lifeline.../id982354972?mt=8">Lifeline...</a></em>,
        an iOS app that I really enjoyed the experience of. It revolved around
        communicating with a stranded astronaut and guiding him to safety through
        the split decisions. Game play was paced in such a way you would receive
        notifications as time progressed and thus allowed you to make further
        decisions.</p>
        <p><em>Wilderness Lifeline</em> uses the same approach, allowing the
        player to check in on Brian's progress and making the user wait until
        Brian has completed a task. However, the delays in response are scaled
        down significantly due to the lack of mobile notifications and for the
        user to experience the story at a much more rapid rate.</p>
