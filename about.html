            <h2>About</h2>
            <p><em>Wilderness Lifeline</em> is a text adventure game where the
              user plays becomes a part of the protagonist's, Brian's,
              consciousness. This creates an internal conversation within the
              character's head, allowing the player to manipulate the path
              Brian takes to survive within the dangers of the Canadian
              Wilderness.</p>

            <h3>Game Style</h3>
            <p>The 'split decision path game' was inspired by
                <em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/lifeline.../id982354972?mt=8">Lifeline...</a></em>, an iOS app that I really enjoyed the experience of. It revolved around communicating with a stranded astronaut and guiding him to safety through
                the split decisions. Game play was paced in such a way you would receive notifications as time progressed and thus allowed you to make further decisions.
            </p>
            <p><em>Wilderness Lifeline</em> uses the same approach, allowing
              the player to check in on Brian's progress and making the user
              wait until Brian has completed a task. However, the delays in
              response are scaled down significantly due to the lack of mobile
              notifications and for the user to experience the story at a much
              more rapid rate.</p>
