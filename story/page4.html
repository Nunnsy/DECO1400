            In the morning light and calm the water was absolutely, perfectly still. He could see the reflections of the trees at the other end of the lake. Upside down in the water they seemed almost like another forest, an upside-down forest to match the real one.
            As he watched, a large bird— he thought it looked like a crow but it seemed larger—flew from the top, real forest, and die reflection-bird matched it, both flying out over the water.

            Everything was green, so green it went into him. The forest was largely made up of pines and spruce, with stands of some low brush smeared here and there and thick grass and some other kind of very small brush all over. He couldn't identify most of it—except
            the evergreens—and some leafy trees he thought might be aspen. He'd seen pictures of aspens in the mountains on television. The country around the lake was moderately hilly, but the hills were small—almost hummocks—and there were very few
            rocks except to his left. There lay a rocky ridge that stuck out overlooking the lake, about twenty feet high.
